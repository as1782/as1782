Motivated and results-driven university student pursuing a degree in economics and finance who is interested in a career in the finance industry particularly investment banking due to a passion in finance, investing and real estate. I enjoy taking on data science projects, building financial models and exploring areas where finance meets technology. I tend to gravitate towards high-stakes and a fast paced environment, and am always looking for opportunities to test my limits. In my spare time I often enjoy a round of golf and taking care of my bonsais.
